                    <p>Greetings everyone, I am a student pursuing B.TECH in computer science from UPES,Dehradun. As a
                        computer enthusiast, I have always been passionate about learning the latest technology and its
                        applications. Apart from academics, I have also been engaging in various extracurricular
                        activities, such as volunteering for social causes and participating in sports. These activities have helped me
                        develop skills like leadership, teamwork, and time management.</p>

                <p>1. Lack of Carbon Capture and Storage Implementation: Incomplete implementation of technologies to
                    capture
                    and store carbon emissions contributes to climate change. This project utilizes formal language and
                    automata theory to address the incomplete implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)
                    technologies in mitigating climate change. By applying rigorous analytical frameworks, we aim to
                    identify and overcome barriers hindering the widespread adoption of CCS, paving the way for more
                    effective climate mitigation strategies.

                <p>2. SAAS application development: The project aims to develop an innovative Expense Tracker SaaS
                    application
                    designed to revolutionize how organizations manage and track their expenses. With a user-friendly
                    interface and powerful features, the app platform offers a comprehensive solution to automate
                    expense
                    reporting, provide actionable insights, and enhance transparency and control over corporate
                    spending.
